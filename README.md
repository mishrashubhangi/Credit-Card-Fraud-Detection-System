# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-System

The project aims to predict the authenticity of credit card transactions with the help of machine learning models like KNN, Random Forest and XGBoost.
Credit Card Fraud Detection Systems is used by banks to protect their customers from fraud. The dataset is taken from kaggle which consists one csv file namely fraudTrain used for both training and testing purposes. The dataset consists of 23 attributes with the target variable as is_fraud.
Accuracy and confusion matrix is used as the evaluation metrics for all the proposed models. After the comparison XGBoost comes out to be the best fit for the given problem with an overall accuracy of 91.77%.
The project also discusses the challenges faced together with the future scope.
